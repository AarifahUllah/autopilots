# How to use capstone.world

## Explanation

<p>Capstone.world is a Gazebo simulation environment. It is supposed to emulate the real settings of the drone flight. You can make this as specific and realistic as you want by defining the gravity, time, wind conditions, etc. Gravity is default 9.8 m/s^2,
but think about simulations on the moon. Specifically for capstone.world the time is defined as early morning with clouds and natural lighting. Morning because the competition starts then and clouds because of a typical cloudy day at Northern Virginia. <br>

The .world file uses XML and SDF standards. Models were used to include drones and ArUco markers. <br> 

Now, other simulations and programs can be written to make the drone model fly within this .world (think of .launch scripts).</p>
